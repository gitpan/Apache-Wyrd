=head1 NAME

Apache::Wyrd::DBL - Centralized location for tracking variables, internals

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	my $hostname = $wyrd->dbl->req->hostname;
	my $database_handle = $wyrd->dbl->dbh;
	my $value = $wyrd->dbl->param('value');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Apache::Wyrd::DBL> ("Das Blinkenlights") is a convenient placeholder for
all session information a Wyrd might need in order to do work.  It holds
references to the session's current apreq, DBI, and Apache objects, as well
as the current session log and other vital information.  It is meant to be
called from within an Apache::Wyrd object through it's C<dbl> method, as in
the SYNOPSIS.

Debugging is always turned on if port 81 is used.  Note that apache must be set
up to listen at this port as well.  See the Listen and BindAddress Apache directives.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item (DBL) C<new> (hashref, hashref)

initialize and return the DBL with a set of startup params and a set of global
variables (for the WO to access) in the form of two hashrefs.  The first hashref
should include at least the 'req' key, which is an Apache request object.

The startup params can have several keys set.  These may be:

=over

=item apr

the param/cookie subsystem (CGI or Apache::Request object initialized by a Apache::Wyrd::Request object);

=item dba

database application.  Should be the name of a DBI::DBD driver.

=item database

database name (to connect to)

=item db_password

database password

=item db_username

database user name

=item loglevel

Logging level, per Apache::Wyrd object

=item globals

pointer to globals hashref

=item req (B<required>)

the request itself (Apache request object)

=item strict

should strict procedures be followed (not used by default)

=item user

the current user (not used by default)
