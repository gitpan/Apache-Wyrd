=head1 NAME

Apache::Wyrd::Handler - Apache Handler object for Apache::Wyrd modules

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	PerlWarn off
	<Directory /var/www/sites/BASENAME>
		SetHandler perl-script
		PerlHandler BASENAME::Handler
	</Directory>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Handler for Apache::Wyrd documents.  For more information on mod_perl
and handlers, see L<http://perl.apache.org/docs/index.html>

This module has been developed for and only been tested in Apache E<lt>
2.0 / mod_perl E<lt> 1.99.  In this environment, the SYNOPSIS shows a
typical set of appropriate Apache directives.  Global Perl warnings are
turned off, as they are more granularly handled within the package. Note
that the Handler that is used is an B<instance> of this handler. It is
named, in this example, C<BASNAME::Handler> and is found in a BASENAME
directory which in @INC of a local mod_perl installation. Traditionally,
this is in C<E<lt>apache configuration directoryE<gt>/lib/perl/>.  If
the perl module BASENAME::Handler has a C<use base
qw(Apache::Wyrd::Handler)> declaration, the C<handler> method should properly
determine the base class for the BASENAME set of Wyrds and the handler
should interpret only those tags beginning E<lt>BASENAME::...  A
rudimentary sample of this usage is available in the t/lib directory of
this package and is used for testing.

This way, several sites using Wyrds can be built, each subclassing
Apache::Wyrd objects in their own idiom without interfering in the
interpretation of the same objects in another BASENAME class.  (However,
nothing prevents a second BASENAME from including the first BASENAME in
its C<use base> declaration array).  This is a feature(tm) of Apache::Wyrd
and is intended to promote code re-use.

The Handler also dumps out the error log, if needed from the DBL, where
it accumulates from it's own internal calls and calls by Wyrds to the
error-level functions (_warn, _error, etc.).  If the "init" hashref has
a non-null key called "error_page", this log will be reverse-dumped in a
standard-looking error page with a backtrace of events.

=head2 METHODS

=over

=item new

Accept and bless a new object.  Provided for tradition's sake, since the handler
method does the real work.

=cut

sub new {
	my ($class, $data) = @_;
	bless $data, $class;
	return $data;
}

=pod

=item handler

Handle the request.  This handler uses the 2 argument function prototype so that
it can be instantiated in another name-space.

In the example Apache directive above, the arguments supplied by the Apache
directive give it the class name "BASENAME".  It uses this BASENAME to determine
what is the base class of all Wyrds it handles.  Consequently, it will only
parse Wyrds which begin with E<lt>BASENAME::...

The handler assembles the Apache request object itself, the initialization hash
for the generation of Apache::Wyrd objects, and the globals used by Apache::DBL.
 It then calls C<process> and C<respond> in sequence.  If all goes well, the
'output' attribute has been set by the response method, and this is returned
with the appropriate headers set.

=cut

sub handler : method {
	my ($class, $req) = @_;
	unless ($class =~ /^([a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_:]*)::Handler/) {
		die "Must instantiate Apache::Wyrd::Handler as a XXXXX::Handler Object  where XXXXX is the base class of the Wyrd-derived objects.";
	}
	my $client = $1;
	my $self = new($class, {
		'req' => $req,
		'client' => $client,
		'output' => '',
		'internal_redirect_counter' => 0,
	});
	$self->{'init'} = $self->init;
	$self->{'init'}->{'globals'} = $self->globals;
	my $response = $self->get_file;
	return $response if ($response);
	$response = $self->process;
	return $response if ($response);
	$response = $self->respond;
	if ($response eq OK) {
		$self->post_process;
		$self->add_headers;
		$req->send_http_header($self->req->headers_out->get('Content-Type') || 'text/html');
		$req->print($self->{'output'});
	} else{
		my $new_response = $self->_exception_handler($response, $req);
		$response = $new_response if ($new_response);
	}
	return $response;
}

#Note: subhandler is experimental.  Don't use it yet.
sub subhandler {
	my ($self, $file) = @_;
	my $req = $self->req;
	die "Too many internal redirects (20)" if ($self->{'internal_redirect_counter'}++ > 20);
	$self->{'file'} = $file;
	my $response = $self->respond;
	if ($response eq OK) {
		warn 'response is OK';
		$self->post_process;
		$self->add_headers;
		$req->send_http_header($self->req->headers_out->get('Content-Type') || 'text/html');
		$req->print($self->{'output'});
	} else{
		warn 'response is an exception';
		my $new_response = $self->_exception_handler($response, $req);
		$response = $new_response if ($new_response);
	}
	return $response;
}

=pod

=item _exception_handler

Before returning a non-OK response, the handler will send two scalars to
this method and if the method returns a response, that response will be sent
instead.  Subclasses of Apache::Wyrd::Handler can use this method to invoke
and return responses from other handlers or generate custom responders.

What arguments for the first
method subclasses of this method accept and how they invoke the responding
entity are entirely up to the programmer.

The default behavior is to redirect full URLs, pass internal redirections
back to the handler, and handle 'request authorization' messages to
Apache::Wyrd::Services::Auth.

=cut

sub _exception_handler {
	my ($self, $response, $req) = @_;
	if ($response eq 'request authorization') {
		return Apache::Wyrd::Services::Auth::handler($req);
	}
	if ($response =~ m#(https?://.+|^/.+)#) {
		my $url = $1;
		$req->custom_response(REDIRECT, $url);
		return REDIRECT;
	}
	#Experimental subhandler method
	if ($response =~ m#^internal_redirect:(.+)#) {
		my $file = $1;
		warn "internal redirect to $file";
		return $self->subhandler($file);
	}
	return;
}

=pod

=item post_process

Called by handler on a successful responses from C<process> and
C<respond>.  A hook for post-processing the final output.  At the point
this method is called, all the output is ready to be sent and is waiting
in the C<output> attribute, so this method traditionally manipulates
C<$self->{'output'}> directly.

=cut

sub post_process {
	my ($self) = @_;
	return;
}
=pod

=item add_headers

Called by handler on a successful responses from C<process> and C<respond>. Adds
some standard headers to the response or can be overridden.  By default, it adds
headers to help with compatibility with AOL's famously broken proxies and other
similar problems.

=cut

sub add_headers {
	my ($self) = @_;
	my $req = $self->{'req'};
	$req->no_cache(1);
	$req->headers_out->set('Vary', '*');
	return;
}

=pod

=item get_file

Based on the request, locates the file to be used and sets the file
attribute to that path.  It declines non-text/html files (via mime type)
and, on accepting a file, passes the mtime and size of the file to the
init hashref for use by the Apache::Wyrd object.

=cut

sub get_file {
	my ($self, $file) = @_;
	$file ||= $self->{'req'}->filename;
	return DECLINED if (-d $file and $self->{'req'}->next);
	return DECLINED unless (-r _);
	return DECLINED unless ($self->{'req'}->content_type eq 'text/html');
	$self->{'file'} = $file;
	my @stats = stat _;
	foreach my $datum (
		qw(
			dev
			ino
			mode
			nlink
			uid
			gid
			rdev
			size
			atime
			mtime
			ctime
			blksize
			blocks
		)
					) {
		$self->{'init'}->{$datum} = shift @stats;
	}
	my $root = $self->{'req'}->document_root;
	$self->{'init'}->{'file_path'} = $file;
	$file =~ s#$root/*#/#;
	$self->{'init'}->{'self_path'} = $file;
	return;
}


=pod

=item globals

defines the hashref which will be kept by the DBL object.  Empty by default.

=cut

sub globals {
	return {};
}

=pod

=item init

defines the hashref which will be used to initialize the Apache::Wyrd objects. 
It B<must> return the request object under the key 'req', which is stored under
the C<Apache::Wyrd::Handler> attribute 'req' by the C<handler> method.  Any
other keys are optional.

By default, if the hash key 'error_page' is set (non-null), the installation
will use an error page with a debugging log.  See the C<errorpage> method.

=cut

sub init {
	my ($self) = @_;
	return {
		req => $self->{'req'}
	};
}


=pod

=item process

"Hook" method for introducing other handling checks to the request.  It should
return an Apache::Constants value if it wants to override the response of the
C<respond> method.  If it does this override, then it is responsible for setting
it's own headers.

=cut

sub process {
	my ($self) = @_;
	return;
};

=pod

=item respond

Does the work of setting up the found page as an Apache::Wyrd object and calling
it's C<output> method.  Should probably not be overridden, unless there are
tweaks that cannot be accomplished in C<add_headers> and C<process>.

=cut

sub respond {
	my ($self) = @_;
	my $client = $self->{'client'};
	my $dbl_create = 'Apache::Wyrd::DBL->new($self->{"init"});';
	my $wo_create = 'Apache::Wyrd->new($dbl, {_data => $$data});';
	if ($self->{'client'}) {
		eval ("use " . $client . "::DBL");
		die ("$@:\nA base class $client\::DBL needs to be defined before using Apache::Wyrd") if ($@);
		eval ("use $client\::Wyrd");
		die ("$@\:\nA base class $client\::Wyrd needs to be defined before using Apache::Wyrd") if ($@);
		$dbl_create =~ s/^Apache::Wyrd/$self->{client}/;
		$wo_create =~ s/^Apache/$self->{client}/;
	}
	my ($dbl, $object) = ();
	eval("\$dbl=$dbl_create");
	die ($@) if ($@);
	my $data = slurp_file($self->{'file'});
	eval("\$object = $wo_create");
	my $response = OK;
	if ($self->{'init'}->{'error_page'}) {
		my $output = undef;
		eval{
			$output = $object->output();
			$object->_shutdown;
		};
		if ($@) {
			my $log = undef;
			$log = ${$dbl->dump_log} if ($dbl->loglevel);
			$self->{'req'}->custom_response(SERVER_ERROR, $self->errorpage($@, $log));
			$response = SERVER_ERROR;
		}
		$dbl->get_response && return $dbl->get_response;
		$self->{'output'} = $output;
	} else {
		#must call output before checking response, or redirects will not occur.
		$self->{'output'} = $object->output();
		$object->_shutdown;
		$dbl->get_response && return $dbl->get_response;
	}
	$dbl->{'logfile'} && $dbl->close_logfile;
	$dbl->{'dbh'} && $dbl->close_db;
	return $response;
}

=pod

=item req

return the Apache request object.  This handle has been initialized in
C<handler>

=cut

sub req {
	my ($self) = @_;
	return $self->{'req'};
}

=pod

=item errorpage

Simply a formatting method.  Given the error and the log in scalar form, outputs
an Error Page with "Internal Server Error" at the top.  Called by C<respond>
when the debugging flags are on.

=cut

sub errorpage {
	my ($self, $error, $log) = @_;
	return <<__PAGE_END__;
<H1>500: Internal Server Error</H1>
<HR>
Specific Error: $@
<HR>
$log
__PAGE_END__
