=head1 NAME

Apache::Wyrd::Interfaces::Stealth - Interface for hidden Wyrds

=head1 SYNOPSIS

NONE

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Interface that automatically "Hides" the member Wyrd from it's children,
so as to apply conditionals to the inside of Wyrds which have
dependencies on their children.

This is useful, say, in enclosing a group of Form::Input wyrds without
disconnecting them from their enclosing form.


=head1 BUGS/CAVEATS/RESERVED METHODS

Overrides the _pre_spawn method.
