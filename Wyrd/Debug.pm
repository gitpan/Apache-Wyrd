=head1 NAME

Apache::Wyrd::Debug - Debugging Wyrd

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	<BASENAME::Debug output="/monitor.html" loglevel="4">
	
	..yada yada yada...
	
	</BASENAME::Debug>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Wyrd for monitoring the debugging process while working with Wyrds.  It is
designed to enclose the entire Wyrd-enabled file.  The debug log will be loaded
on a popup window in the browser (you will need to enable popups).

B<Note:> You will almost certainly want to specify a loglevel higher than the
default of 1/error.

=head2 HTML ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item output

The file (on the web site where the debugging is taking place) which
will be used to monitor the debugging.  The file should be writeable by
the server and should be visible to the browser.  It should begin with a
'/' and contain the path from the document root to the file, as if it
was an absolute path to another page on the same site inside the href
attribute of an anchor tag.

=item logfile

The file where the log is temporarily stored while processing.  By
default, this will be a file under /tmp, but if this is not possible,
you should specify it. It must be writeable by the server.
