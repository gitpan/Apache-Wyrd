Wishes, pipe-dreams, etc.

-   Modify installation Makefile.PL to use PM_FILTER to allow #ifdefine -
    style commenting out of all debugging code.

-   Security-enhanced version that prevents read-access to CodeRing
    cryptography key values or "cookie-stealing": partially addressed by
    IP-tying in v. 94.

-   Integration with CSS/Javascript/Ajax -- e.g.
    Apache::Wyrd::Interfaces::SmartInput kind of begs to be integrated with a
    style-sheet generator of some kind, Apache::Wyrd::Input should have some
    conditional validation on the client side.

-   Trace and debugging information from DBI automatically using
    $dbh->handle_<foo>

-   Automatic useage message via override on errors

-   Base Wyrd object should be either more seperable or totally inseperable
    from an Apache::Wyrd::DBL object.

-   General audit to enforce object-model integrity and interface consistency,
    possibly a rewrite using closures instead of the "old style" references.
