List of known problems:

-	Base Wyrd object should be either more seperable or totally inseperable
	from an Apache::Wyrd::DBL object.

-	General audit needed to enforce object-model integrity and
	interface consistency

List of known problems which will not be fixed, and why:

-	Wyrds should be case-insensitive: too cycle-costly and only encourages
	sloppiness.  Attributes are already case-insensitive.

-	Should be able to put HTML within the attributes inside the Wyrd tag:
	Only a few instances can't be done with Attribute Wyrds, and those will
	likely require an additional mini-interpreter "language" like the
	Apache::Wyrd::Services::Setter conditional mini-language for escaping
	HTML:  This would likely be cycle-costly.

-	Wyrds should not encourage polluting the system-wide module
	namespace:  Guilty as charged.

-	It should work more like PHP or Mason: No need to duplicate effort. If
	PHP or Mason works for you, use it!

-	The _self_parse method which is integral to the Wyrd object is
	functionally incompatible with the idea of a "non-parsed-header"
	document:  It makes more sense to use something else hand-coded if you
	need to do that.
